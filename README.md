## Project Description
VibeRide is an online-first, responsive web application that helps motorcycle enthusiasts quickly transform simple trip notes into engaging, high-level itineraries and downloadable GPX 1.1 files. The MVP targets three core rider personas‚Äîweekend group riders, after-work short-loop riders, and long-trip tourers‚Äîproviding them with an AI-assisted planning flow that starts from a plain-text note and ends with an itinerary ready for the road.

Core flow: sign in with Google ‚Üí complete riding preferences profile ‚Üí create/edit a note ‚Üí generate itinerary ‚Üí review/regenerate ‚Üí download GPX (after safety disclaimer) ‚Üí browse past notes.

All data is stored in Supabase, AI generation is handled by OpenAI via Openrouter, and the entire app can be run locally in Docker or using Node.

## Tech Stack
### Frontend
- Astro 5
- React 19
- TypeScript 5
- Tailwind CSS 4
- Shadcn/ui

### Backend & Data
- Supabase (PostgreSQL & Auth)

### AI & Integrations
- Openrouter.ai (OpenAI compatible)

### Tooling & DevOps
- ESLint, Prettier, Husky, lint-staged
- Docker (local development)
- GitHub Actions (CI)
- DigitalOcean (target hosting)

## Getting Started Locally
### Prerequisites
```bash
# Recommended Node version
nvm install 22.14.0
nvm use 22.14.0

# Package manager (optional if already up-to-date)
npm install -g npm@latest
```

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/VibeRide.git
cd VibeRide
```
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
3. Configure environment variables:
```bash
# Create a `.env` file at the project root and populate the variables below
```
Required variables:
